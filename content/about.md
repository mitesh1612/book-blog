Hey there. I am Mitesh Shah, author of this blog. I work as a Software Engineer in Microsoft and love to read a lot in my free time. Over the time I kept reading, I kept collecting notes or things to remember by in documents or notes or Kindle highlights. I always felt like this isnt a good way to store or organize the information that I am gathering and thus decided to create a blog. This blog would contain tidbits that I loved from a certain book, half-assed reviews (because I dont consider myself to be a book critic of any kind) and how I felt after reading the given book.

If you ahve any complaints or issues with the content I write, please create an issue on the GitHub repo of this blog and I will address it as soon as I can. The link for the GitHub repo of this blog can be found [here](https://github.com/mitesh1612/book-blog).
